Here is my program for Demo3 called ISS MapChecker. You are able to specify a default city in the settings of the application in order to have a city set as default. What you do with this application is either get the current location of the ISS (International Space Station) and have it appear on a map, Or you can enter a city and state in the form of (City,StateAbbreviation) in order to get the times in which the ISS will pass over the city.
